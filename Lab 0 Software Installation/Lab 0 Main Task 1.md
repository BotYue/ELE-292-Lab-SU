## :dart: Task 1 – Digilent WaveForms
---

#### 📌 Task 1.1 Know the hardware

Each group should get:
- One **Micro USB Cable**
- One **blue workbench**

Leave the USB unconnected for now. The main component of the workbench is the **Analog Discovery 2** — a portable device that includes an oscilloscope, power supply, waveform generator, network analyzer, and more.

The pinout is shown on the left below. These pins are connected to a breadboard using a T-shaped connector. The T-shape connector neatly
organize wires from the Analog Discovery 2 for easier connection.
