#### Notes on Conclusion Writing

At the end of each lab report, you must write a **conclusion**. This is part of your program requirement:

> *“An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.”*

For this course, you must include a conclusion in **every lab report**.

##### Rules

* ❌ Do **not** copy from your teammate.
* ❌ Do **not** use AI generation such as ChatGPT.
* ✅ Must be **longer than 80 words**.

##### Suggested Content

Your conclusion can cover:

* Purpose, hardware/software, and brief experimental procedures
* Overall assessment of the experimental results
* Challenges encountered and how you resolved them (if any)

##### 📑 Sample (133 words)

*The purpose of Lab 6 is to study a first-order linear system using a resistor-based heating setup. The system is modeled with power as the input and Celsius temperature as the output. With PWM-controlled input power, we used Analog Discovery 2 and Arduino to measure the corresponding temperature output.*

*In the experiment, we observed the expected proportional relationship between the power input and the temperature output. This observation aligns with the scalability of linear systems. Also, we calculated the time constant to be 60 seconds, which we believe is reasonably long for this heating system.*

*During the experiment, it took a long time to wait for cooling down, which made the lab duration quite long. In addition, we had difficulty figuring out how to align the voltage divider with the Arduino sensor readings.*
