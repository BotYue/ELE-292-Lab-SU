# Lab 2 Impulse Response


## :dart: Task 1 â€“ System Modeling
---

In this lab, we will use a **series RL** circuit to model a first-order system.

We want to treat the circuit as a **System** .

Thus we need to specify the following:

- **System Input:** We set the voltage of the source, $V_{in}(t)$, as the system input.  
  This can be set-up via Wavegen in the WaveForms.
- **System Output:** We set the voltage of the resistor $V_{R}(t)$ as the system output.  
  This can be measured via Scope in the WaveForms.

- **System Model:** To be calculated

----------
### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.1 Derive the System Model (Individual)

Analyze the circuit, we have:

$$
V_{in}(t) =  V_L(t) + V_R(t) = L\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t)R 
$$

$$
V_{out}(t) = V_R(t) = I(t)R
$$

Apply Laplace Transform:

$$
V_{in}(s) =  LsI(s) + I(s)R 
$$

$$
V_{out}(s) = I(s)R
$$

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-a
Find the system model in Laplace domain (known as Transfer Function):
 
$$
\frac{V_{out}(s)}{V_{in}(s)} = ???
$$

> [!NOTE]
> For typing math answers in the report, you need to type the entire
equation and a short text description, not only type the part corresponding to ???.
This rubric applies to all math answers in the semester.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.2 Caculate Impulse Response in Theory (Individual)

Today, our input will be an impulse signal. Let's write it as

$$
V_{in}(t) = A \delta(t)
$$

Here, $A$ is a constant (scalar).

This impulse input $V_{in}(t)=A\delta(t)$ converts to Laplace domain as $V_{in}(s)=A\cdot 1=A$. 

Then we can obtain the system output (also called response) by multiplying the Transfer Function and input in Laplace domain.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-b

In Laplace domain, the output is

$$V_{out}(s) = ???$$

Transform back to the time domain, the output is 

$$V_{out}(t) = ???$$

> [!TIP]
> result should be in terms of $R, L, A$
