## :dart: Task 2 – Temperature sensor reading
---

**Component Used**

* One Kookye TMP36 Temperature Sensor

Insert the three leads of the TMP36 into separate rows of the breadboard.

Make its flat surface facing toward you. This will help you correctly identify the pins.

-----
We will use the **Analog Discovery** to study its characteristics.

**Pin-to-Lead:**  
- Analog Discovery `W1` → `left lead` (sensor's Vin) 
- Analog Discovery `1+`  → `middle lead` (sensor's analog voltage output)  
- Analog Discovery `1-` → Analog Discovery Ground `↓` → `right lead` (sensor's ground)
