# Lab 5 Arduino II

The 5 continues the introduction on Arduino basics, with emphasis on I/O.

Recall the pinout of **Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express**,

* **Analog input**: All pins labeled with **AIN** can do analog input. We recommend use from **Pin A1** to **Pin A5**.
* **True analog output**: **Pin A0** is the only true analog output pin. It is labeled by **VOUT**
* **PWM output**: Most pins labeled with **D** can do PWM output. We recommend use from **Pin 9** to **Pin 13**

## :dart: Task 1 â€“ Joystick Analog Reading

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.1 Circuit Setup

Task 1 requires you to analyze the joystick analog readings using the Analog Discovery 2. This will prepare you for the Task 2 Arduino set-up.

**Components Used:**

* one KY-023 analog joystick
* one workbench with Analog Discovery 2
* No need for Arduino in Task 1
----------
<img src="Pic/joystick.png" width="300">

The **VRX** and **VRY** pins output analog voltages for the X- and Y-axis positions.

 The **SW** pin is a digital push-button input. We wonâ€™t use it.

 Internally, **VRX** and **VRY** are driven by simple potentiometer-based voltage divider.

----------
**Connection Requirement:**

* Use `Wavegen` in Analog Discovery to provide 5 V DC to the joystick. 
* Use `Scope Channel 1` in Analog Discovery to measure the voltage (**VRX**) for X-position of the joystick. 
* Use `Scope Channel 2` in Analog Discovery to measure the voltage (**VRY**) for Y-position of the joystick. 
* Ensure all grounds are properly connected, including:
   * both `Scope Channel` negative pins,
   * Analog Discovery Ground `â†“`
   * joystick Ground

> [!NOTE]  
> You have completed multiple labs already. This time you are expected to handle the wiring **by yourself**.
> 
> No detailed pin-to-pin connection will be provided.

> [!TIP]  
> If you have too many ground wires, organize them to the blue rail of your breadboard.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.2 Scope Reading

Configue your **Wavegen** to provide 5 V DC.

Open your **Scope**, 
* Change the Mode from **Repeated** to **Screen**
* Use 2 s/div for Time Base
* Make sure both Channels are ticked.

Move the joystick in different directions, observe and understand the voltage.

* You may need to adjust the Channel Offset and Range to observe the full signal.

Based on the joystick direction in the picture, measure and fill the table.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-a



| Joystick Direction |  VRX Voltage (X-axis)  |  VRY Voltage (Y-axis)  |
| :----------------- | :--------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Center             |         â‰ˆ 2.50 V        |         â‰ˆ 2.50 V        |
| Move Rightmost          |  ?? V|         ??  V     |
| Move Upmost            |   ??   V   | ?? V|
| Move Downmost          |    ??  V     | ?? V|

> [!NOTE]
> Leftmost position may be blocked by the breadboard. You don't need to add this in table.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.3 Record 2-Channel Data

Record the scope voltages corresponding to the following continuous movement sequence:
1. Use 1 second to slowly move the joystick from center to the topmost position
2. Hold it there for 1 second
3. Use 1 second to slowly move it back to the center.
4. Use 1 second to slowly move the joystick from center to the rightmost position
5. Hold it there for 1 second
6. Use 1 second to slowly move it back to the center.

Then export as .csv for later use.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-b

Provide the screenshot of the display of your Scope. Showing the full movement sequence.

> [!NOTE]
> Include the local time and device Serial Number (Discovery 2 C SN: ..) in the screenshot.
> Use computer-built-in app to screenshot. Not use your phone camera to take pictures.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.4 Plot Movement Trajectory (Individual)

**Clean-up Data:**

When exporting data in Screen Mode, the first recorded data row is often inaccurate due to buffer.

So, open your exported .csv, deleta the first data row.


#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-c (Individual)
In Jupyter Notebook, use Python to plot **the trajectory of the joystick movement**:
* Plot one Channel voltage as X-axis
* Plot the other Channel voltage as Y-axis
* You can name axis labels as "left-right direction" or "up-down direction" without unit.

Show both code and generated plot in the report.
