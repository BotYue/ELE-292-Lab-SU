## :dart: Task 3 – Joystick with Arduino

### 📌 Task 2.1 Circuit Setup

You have studied the characteristics of joystick analog reading. Now we will combine it with Arduino.

**Components Used:**

* one KY-023 analog joystick
* one Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express

**Connection Requirement:**

* Use `VHI` in Arduino to provide 5 V DC to the joystick. 
* Use one Analog input pin to measure the voltage (**VRX**) for X-position of the joystick. 
* Use another Analog input pin to measure the voltage (**VRY**) for Y-position of the joystick. 
* Ensure Arduino `G` is connected to the joystick Ground

---
### 📌 Task 2.2 Arduino Code

Write Arduino Code to
* Read the voltages (**VRX**, **VRY**) from both analog input pins
* Print out both voltages via Serial Monitor

> [!TIP]
> You can re-visit the Lab 4 Main Task 3 code to understand how to obtain pin voltage and print.

Open the Serial Monitor. 

* Make sure your joystick is in **Center position**. Un-click “AutoScrolling”. Copy 10 consecutive output lines and paste them below.

### 📌 Task 2.3 The 3.3 V Saturation Issue 

From your Task 1 measurement, you can see the actuall Pin voltages are 2.5 V & 5 V. 

But in Task 2.2, your Arduino gives you 2.5 V & 3.3 V print-out. 

This is a **3.3 V Saturation Issue** in Arduino:<br> Arduino’s ADC reference is 3.3 V. Any analog input above 3.3 V saturates and gets read as 3.3 V.

To correctly measure higher voltages on an analog pin, you must place an intermediate circuit between the raw voltage pin and the Arduino. We commonly use a **Voltage Divider**.

----

Here is an example circuit.

If you use 2 identical resistors for a voltage divider, the output voltage will be half of the input voltage.

This means that even the max 5 V of VRX/VRY Pin, the divided output becomes 2.5 V, which stays within the Arduino’s 3.3 V ADC range.

---------
It is your job to build the extra voltage divider and modify the Arduino code. Such that you can get 5 V print-out when at Rightmost position.

> [!TIP]
> **Pick appropriate values for voltage divider resistors.**
>
> (Joystick internal resistance = 10 kΩ; Arduino ADC internal resistance ≈ 1 MΩ)
>
> To avoid effects from either side, choose your divider resistors between these two values.

### ✅ Check Point 2 — Arduino Print Voltage

- Return components to their proper bins.
- Place the blue workbench on the shelf in the correct order:  
  *(EECS 1–2, EECS 3–4, EECS 5–6, …)*
