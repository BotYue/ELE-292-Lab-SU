# Lab 6 Thermal System

## :dart: Task 1 â€“Introduction


In Lab6, we will study a **first order thermal system**.

Specifically, we will focus the **step response** of this system.

We will also continue to practice the usage of Analog Discovery and Arduino.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.1 Pre Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> you must do this first.

Many Arduino has previously uploaded code. We never know who uploaded what code on
it.

Connect USB to Arduino without any jump wires. 

Run this code first to reset the commonly used PWN pins.

After completion, unplug the USB.

```c
// This code resets PWM pins 7,9,10,11,12 to 0 duty cycle
void setup() {
analogWrite(12, 0);
analogWrite(11, 0);
analogWrite(10, 0);
analogWrite(9, 0);
analogWrite(7, 0);
}
void loop() {
}
```

### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.2 Actual System Introduction

The actual system is this board named "Temperature Control":

<img src="Pic/boardsystem.png" width="300">

* The green resistor is the load to be heated.
* The chip under the green resistor is a temperature sensor.
* The half-cylinder item is a 2N7000 MOSFET and acts as a logic switch. The MOSFET
will be fully turned on if a gate signal is above 3 V.

	In this lab, we use a 3.3 V PWM signal as the gate signal to turn on MOSFET.
So the switch will be on when PWM signal is High, will be off when PWM is Zero.
* The +5 V DC is the voltage of the main circuit loop.


### ðŸ“Œ Task 1.3 Wiring Explained

Overall, the board can be simply considered as such connection:

<img src="Pic/schematic.png" width="600">

â–ª The **+5 V DC** is drawn from the **Pin Vhi** of the ItsyBitsy M0 Express.
â€ƒThis 5 V DC supplies power to heat up the resistor.

â–ª The **PWM signal** is controlled by the **PWM pin** of the Arduino.
â€ƒIt adjusts the heat-power input to the heated resistor.

â–ª The resistorâ€™s temperature is measured by a chip underneath it.
â€ƒThe chip outputs a voltage to the **Temp Pin**, following the relation:

$$\mathrm{Temperature (Â°C)} = \dfrac{\mathrm{V (volts)}}{0.100}$$

For example, if the temperature is 23 Â°C, the chip outputs 2.3 V.
Use the **Analog Discovery** to measure this sensor voltage.
