# Lab 6 Thermal System

## :dart: Task 1 –Introduction


In Lab6, we will study a **first order thermal system**.

Specifically, we will focus the **step response** of this system.

We will also continue to practice the usage of Analog Discovery and Arduino.

### 📌 Task 1.1 Pre Setup
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> you must do this first.

Many Arduino has previously uploaded code. We never know who uploaded what code on
it.

Connect USB to Arduino without any jump wires. 

Run this code first to reset the commonly used PWN pins.

After completion, unplug the USB.

```c
// This code resets PWM pins 7,9,10,11,12 to 0 duty cycle
void setup() {
analogWrite(12, 0);
analogWrite(11, 0);
analogWrite(10, 0);
analogWrite(9, 0);
analogWrite(7, 0);
}
void loop() {
}
```

### 📌 Task 1.2 Actual System

The actual system is this board named "Temperature Control":

<img src="Pic/boardsystem.png" width="300">

* The green resistor is the load to be heated.
* The chip under the green resistor is a temperature sensor.
* The half-cylinder item is a 2N7000 MOSFET and acts as a logic switch. The MOSFET
will be fully turned on if a gate signal is above 3 V.

	In this lab, we use a 3.3 V PWM signal as the gate signal to turn on MOSFET.
So the switch will be on when PWM signal is High, will be off when PWM is Zero.
* The +5 V DC is the voltage of the main circuit loop.

Overall, the board can be simply considered as such connection:

<img src="Pic/schematic.png" width="600">

▪ The **+5 V DC** will be drawn from the Pin Vhi of ItsyBitsy M0 Express. This 5V DC heats up the resistor.

▪ The **PWM** will be controlled by the PWM pin of Arduino. It controls the heat-power input towards the heated resistor.

▪ The resistor’s temperature is measured by a chip under it. The chip outputs a voltage to the **Temp Pin**:

$$\mathrm{Temperature (°C)} = \dfrac{\mathrm{V (volts)}}{0.100}$$

For example, if temperature is 23 °C, the chip outputs 2.3 V voltage.

We use Analog Discovery to measure this sensor voltage.
