# Lab 6 Thermal System

## :dart: Task 3 System Analysis (Individual)

In this task, you will analyze the system based on the **theoretical model in Task 1** and **experimental data capture in Task 2.**

### ðŸ“Œ Task 3.1 Temperature-axis Parameter Estimation (Individual)

Based on your Task 2 experimental data and plot, estimate the parameters related with Temperature-axis, based on:

$$T_{chip}(t) = T_{ss}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau}\right)+T_{room}$$

| **Parameter**                       | **Estimated Value** | 
|:--------------:|:------------------:|
| $T_{room}$ |                    |           |     
| $T_{ss}$ |                    |           |     

> [!TIP]
> You can use vertical lines on your Python plot [`plt.axhline(y=??, color='??')`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.axhline.html) to visually fine-tune the parameter estimation.


### ðŸ“Œ Task 3.2 Time-axis Parameter Estimation (Individual)

In this theoretical response equation,

$$T_{chip}(t) = T_{ss}\left(1 - e^{-t/\tau}\right)+T_{room}$$

You can see the Time Constant of the system is $\tau$ (Unit: seconds) in the theoretical model.

* First, make a **rough estimate** of the Time Constant value $\tau$.

* Then, use the theoretical response equation, plugging your previously estimated parameters $T_{room}$ and $T_{ss}$ , to **plot the theoretical response** on the same figure as your experimental data.

* Next, fine-adjust the Time Constant value gradually, until the theoretical response and the experimental data **visually overlap** as closely as possible.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 3-b (Individual)
Indicate your final estimated Time Constant.

> [!NOTE]
> Time Constant has a unit

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 3-c (Individual)
Provide a single figure showing both the experimental data and the theoretical response (show both code and generated plot).

Your figure should have proper title, legend, x/y axis labels, units.
