# Lab 6 Sine & Bode

## :dart: Task 2 â€“ Manually Obtain Bode

In this task, we will use the **Wavegen** and **Scope** tools to collect a large number of inputâ€“output data pairs from the circuit. 

Using the collected data, we will then manually create a Bode Magnitude plot for the circuit system.

### ðŸ“Œ Task 2.1 Frequency Sweep

**Input Signal is setup by Wavegen setup:**
| Setting   | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Type |  Sine     |
| Frequency  |   To be determined (denoted as $f$)  |
| Amplitude |   5 V    |
| Offset    |   0 V    |
| Symmetry    |   50 %    |
| Phase    |   0    |
