### ðŸ“Œ **Task 4.1 â€“ Manual Bode vs. Theory**

In Jupyter Notebook, use Python to plot **on the same figure**:
1) the manually obtained Bode Mag plot from Task 2
2) the theoretical Bode Mag plot based on the Transfer Function in Task 1

The figure should use Frequency (Hz) as X-axis, use Magnitude (dB) as Y-axis.

The figure should have proper title, legend, x/y axis labels, units.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 4-a (Individual)

Show both code and generated plot in the report.

> [!TIP]
> For how to plot Bode from a Transfer Function, you can refer to https://github.com/BotYue/ELE-251-25Sp-SU-Open/blob/main/Section%202/Notebook%202_7%20key.ipynb
>
> You should create a new array for the theoretical frequencies using: `np.logspace(?, ?, 1000)`

### ðŸ“Œ **Task 4.2 â€“ Auto Bode vs. Theory**

In Jupyter Notebook, use Python to plot **on the same figure**:
1) the automatically obtained Bode Mag plot from Task 3. (load your save `.csv` and plot)
2) the theoretical Bode Mag plot based on the Transfer Function in Task 1

The figure should use Frequency (Hz) as X-axis, use Magnitude (dB) as Y-axis.

The figure should have proper title, legend, x/y axis labels, units.
