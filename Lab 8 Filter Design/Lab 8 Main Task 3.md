## :dart: Task 3 – Active Low-pass Filter

Keep the Wavegen input from previous tasks.

---
### 📌 Task 3.1 Filter Design
For the previous input signal, we can design an **active low-pass filter** to make it less noisy. 

From a Linear System perspective, this means passing the input $x(t) = \sin(50t) + 0.2\sin(1000t)$ through a filter system,<br> so that the **main signal amplitude remains nearly unchanged**, while the **noise part gets attenuated**.

In Filter Deisng, we will pick an cut-off frequency 

In the filter design process, we select a **cutoff frequency** that lies between the two frequency components of the signal
