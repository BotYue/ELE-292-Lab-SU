# Lab 9 Pendulum I

## :dart: Task 1 – Set-up

---
### 📌 Task 1.1 Place the pendulum
Take a pendulum and set it on the workbench.

Fix the pendulum to the blue surface using two nuts and bolts. Ensure that, when the
pendulum swings, it has enough space and won’t collide with anything.

You can use hand or this tool to tighten the nuts.

You need to dis-assemble it at the end of class. So don’t tighten it very very firmly.

### 📌 Task 1.2 Connect the Pot

The pendulum is equipped with a rotary potentiometer (Pot). This rotary potentiometer
can act as an angle sensor.

We connect the pendulum with ItsyBitsy M0 Express as follows:

| **Pnedulum** | **Arduino** |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Red wire ($V_{in}$) | Pin 3V (provides 3.3 V DC) |
| Yellow wire ($V_{out}$) | Any Pin can do AnalogRead |
| Black wire ($GND$) | Pin G |

### ✅ Keep running and unchanged. Proceed to Task 2. No Check Point here.
