# Lab 9 Pendulum I

## :dart: Task 2 – Obtain Impulse Response

---
### 📌 Task 1.1 Tap and Record
Set up your Arduino code, such that it can keep printing out real-time and corresponding
real-time voltage at each line in Serial Monitor.

* Tap the end of pendulum to make it swing. This can be considered as an impulse input
  $A\delta (t)$ in unknown amplitude $A$
*  Make your pendulum’s first swing angle reach about 40 degrees.
*  Clear the Serial Monitor about 2–3 seconds before tapping. This way, you can capture
  some initial timing data, instead of capturing too long time.
* Use Arduino’s Serial Monitor to record data and then load into Python.
*  You can check your Lab 4 Report - Task 3 for reference.
