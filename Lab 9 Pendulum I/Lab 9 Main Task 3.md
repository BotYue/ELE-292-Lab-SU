## :dart: Task 3 – Matplotlib Interactive Measurement

--------

From the previous Report Item, you should obtain a plot in shape as the impulse response of a second-order system.

The next task is to measure the following quantities on the plot:

|**$\Delta T$** is time difference (second), **$\Delta \theta$** is angle difference (Deg) |

To measure these quantities directly on your plot, you can use `matplotlib.pyplot.ginput` tool and `tkinter` GUI.
