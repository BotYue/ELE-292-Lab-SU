We will repeat the same set-up and wiring as the lab last week.

You should refer to the details in [Lab 9 Main Task 1](../Lab%209%20Pendulum%20I/Lab%209%20Main%20Task%201.md)

Since you may get a different pendulum as last week. You should re-do the measurement for its downward center position.

#### :pencil2:  Report Item 1-a

Record the measured $V_{out}$ in the table.
